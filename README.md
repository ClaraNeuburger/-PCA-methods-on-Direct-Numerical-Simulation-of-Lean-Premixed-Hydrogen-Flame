The goals during the three weeks internship was to analyse this new set of data, try different PCA
techniques that will be explained in the following sections, test multiple parameters and see their influence
on the dataset.
This internship was more oriented on the machine learning aspect than the combustion part as i had very
little training on the latter.
The analysis is done on MATLAB with a code given, the code available in this repository are the modifications added to the code.
